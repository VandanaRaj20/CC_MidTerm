# CC_MidTerm
For the midterm, I had to face certain problems with my code. As per my original proposal, I tried to integrate the p5Play library to make my initial pseudo code work. Still, unfortunately, it did not work in any IDE or online editors I tried. Hence, I decided to change my project proposal a bit, but the project will still be a game that is interactive and fun to play!

As someone who enjoys classic games, I have always wanted to develop games that are easy and fun for everyone (like Pacman!). That passion inspired me to use this opportunity to create something I have always wanted to do. Even though my game isnâ€™t that aesthetically pleasing, I decided to make it easy for everyone to access and play!
